# Music Player App

- Built using Flutter, to support both Android, iOS (wiil extend this to desktop application and maybe a website in the future)
- BLOC architecture will be used for state management.

- Will later work on backend code to provide users songs, along with integration of AI to curate playlists based on a user's mood, and make tune suggestions to users.
- This projeect is for personal practise and exploration.
